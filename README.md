# Mila Perez Labs
 This is my lab homework

 I made the main scene then added two sprites (fox and pack of birds).
 My other scences consist of rocks and trees.

 I watched yoour YT video about Godot but I need to go back and understand how the parent works. 
 It annoyed me throughout the process but 
 I think if I pay more attention to what I am doing I could find easier ways to alter things.

I'm excited to learn more!
